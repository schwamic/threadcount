# UNSEEN â€“ THREADCOUNT

For CO-OP, Der Greif exhibited a collection of images in a grid on 09/21/2017 at Unseen Amsterdam. Each picture was printed 25 times and remained visible until all 25 copies were removed from the audience. Once an image was completely removed from the physical space, it was also marked as removed on the website so that the online space "responded" to the physical space and viewers could see the audience's reactions in the space online. Thus, the project created a juxtaposition of "virtual space" and physical space.
