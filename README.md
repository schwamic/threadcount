# UNSEEN â€“ THREADCOUNT

For CO-OP Der Greif exhibited a collection of pictures in a grid. The visitors were allowed to take the pictures with them. Each picture was printed 25 times and remained visible until all 25 copies were removed from the audience. Once an image was completely removed from the physical space, it was also marked as removed on the website, so that the online space "responded" to the physical space and viewers could see the audience's reactions in the space online. Thus, the project created a juxtaposition between "virtual space" and physical space.
